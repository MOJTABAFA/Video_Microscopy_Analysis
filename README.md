## Analysis of Viral Propagation and Cardiomyocyte Activity

This project explores two significant areas of cellular analysis using time-lapse imaging: assessing the propagation of a virus among neighboring cells and evaluating the contractile behavior of cardiomyocytes.

### Problem 1: Measuring Viral Propagation Over Time

**Dataset Overview**  
The dataset for this analysis is provided in the stack `problem1_viralpropagation.tif`, which consists of a two-channel time-lapse capturing:
- **Phase contrast** (Channel 1)
- **Viral expression** (Channel 2)

This dataset records the infection progression over time, where the second channel indicates viral expression levels within individual cells. The virus studied induces syncytium formation, causing single-nucleus cells to merge into multi-nucleated cells. The data was acquired using a 20x objective lens, with an approximate pixel size of 300 nm and a time interval of 15 minutes between frames.

**Analysis Objectives**
- **Rate of Viral Expression Growth**: Quantify the rate at which viral expression increases in a cell after infection.
- **Infection Cycle Duration**: Measure the time it takes for a newly infected cell to reach viral titer levels comparable to previously infected cells within the field of view.
- **(Bonus)** Comparison of Nuclear Movement: Analyze and compare the movement speed of nuclei between infected and uninfected cells.

### Problem 2: Measuring Contractile Activity of Cardiomyocytes

**Dataset Overview**  
The dataset `problem2_beatingcardiomyocytes.tif` is a label-free time-lapse recording showing the intrinsic anisotropy (birefringence) of cardiomyocytes, highlighting:
- The anisotropic myofibrils visible within cardiomyocytes against an isotropic background.

This data was captured at a high frame rate of 100 fps, with an approximate pixel size of 100 nm, providing detailed visual insights into cardiomyocyte contractility.

**Analysis Objectives**
- **Directional Movement Mapping**: Generate a map that visualizes the direction of movement of myofibrils and other cellular components.
- **Magnitude of Movement Mapping**: Create a map that indicates the magnitude of movement for myofibrils and other cellular structures.
- **(Bonus)** Myofibril Orientation and Beat Alignment: Assess the alignment between the orientation of myofibrils and the local direction of contraction, disregarding other cellular structures.

These analyses offer valuable insights into the dynamics of viral infection and the contractile behavior of cardiomyocytes, enhancing our understanding of cellular functions through advanced image analysis techniques.
