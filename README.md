## Problem-1 Measure the propogation of the virus over time between neighboring cells.
The stack `problem1_viralpropagation.tif` is a two-channel (phase and viral expression) time-lapse of the infection process. The second channel reports the amount of virus expressed in each cell. This specific virus causes the cells to form syncitia, i.e., it causes cells with single nuclei to fuse into multi-nucleated cells.  The data was acquired with 20x objective with an approximate pixel size of 300nm and the time interval of 15 min between frames.

From this movie, measure the following:

a. Rate at which the expression of virus grows once a cell is infected.

b. The duration of the infection cycle in this field of view. For example, how long does it take a newly infected cell to express virus titers similar to the previously infected cells?

c. (bonus) Difference in speed at which nuclei of the uinfected and infected cells move.

## Problem-2 Measure the local contractile activity of beating cardiomyocytes.
The stack `problem2_beatingcardiomyocytes.tif` is a label-free time-lapse of intrinsic anisotropy (birefringence) of cardiomyocytes. The anisotropic myofibrils within cardiomyocytes are visible against isotropic background.  The movie was acquired at 100fps and the pixel size is approrximately 100nm. 

From this movie, measure the following:

a. Map of the direction of movement of myofibrils and other cell components.

b. Map of the magnitude of movement of myofibrils and other cell components.

c. (bonus) Alignment between the orientation of myofibril and the local direction of beat, ignoring other cellular structures.
